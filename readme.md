# Full Stack Web Application Deployment

This project involves deploying a Dockerized full-stack web application using Terraform to create AWS resources and Docker to manage the application containers.

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary files and instructions to deploy a full-stack web application. The deployment process is divided into two main stages:

1. **Infrastructure Setup**: Using Terraform to provision AWS resources.
2. **Application Setup**: Using Docker and Docker Compose to set up and run the frontend and backend services.

## Getting Started

To deploy this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Infrastructure Setup

Navigate to the `infrastructure` directory and follow the readme in the directory.

```sh
cd infrastructure
```
## Additional Information

- Each subdirectory (`infrastructure`, `frontend`, and `backend`) contains its own `README.md` file with more detailed instructions specific to that part of the project.
- Ensure the AWS CLI is configured with the appropriate credentials before running the Terraform commands.
- Review and customize the Terraform and Docker Compose files as needed for your specific requirements.
